# WhatRain
What's rain?

This simple plugin remove and prevents rain/storm/snow in all worlds, set default gamemode to creative, set both "doDaylightCycle" and "doWeatherCycle" gamerules to false and set the world time to 0 each time you start the server.

Should work in all bukkit versions, you just have to edit plugin.yml with your API version, but first look at the release tab, there are some precompiles versions for you to choose from.

Useful when testing your plugins, mainly when you need to delete a world and the new world comes without any config. NO. MORE. RAIN.
